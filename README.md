  -- Purpose:

    MVVM

Frameworks used:
  1.) Combine & CombineCocoa:
        
        Used to enable reactive programming by setting up publishers and subcribers 
        amoungst the view components and the view controller to update the UI as the 
        user interacts with the UI 
  
  2.) SnapKit:
        
        Used to enable autolayout in the view components 

  3.) AVFoundation:
        
        Double tapping the logo/title at the top of the UI resets 
        the entire view and plays sound to verify the double tap gesture
